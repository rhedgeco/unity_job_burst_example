# Unity Job System and Burst Compiler Example
This repo is an example using Unitys Job System and Burst Compile.

The system procedurally generates a plane with tens of thousands of vertices.
Every frame it advances a noise algorithm and modifies the vertices of the mesh.
It also generates a lower resolution mesh to use as a physics collider.
